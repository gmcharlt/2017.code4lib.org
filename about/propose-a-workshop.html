                    The pre-conference sessions give folks a space to share and build knowledge, as well as to teach
                    attendees new skills relevant to library technology. Preconference sessions can range from workshops
                    to working sessions, and we welcome a variety of ideas.

                    If you're looking for inspiration, there are many great examples of pre-conferences from last year.

                    We are taking proposals until Tuesday, November 8th, 5 PM Pacific Time / 8 PM Eastern Time. After a
                    period of public voting on workshops, we hope to confirm sessions with the facilitators shortly after.
