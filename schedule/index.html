                <h3>Newcomer Dinner</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a Code4Lib tradition to welcome those who are new to the conference
                    by organizing dinner groups on the night before the general conference begins.
                    Sign-up is organized by the <a href="http://wiki.code4lib.org/2017_Conference_Committees#Social_Activities">Social Activities Committee</a>
                    on the wiki, and we try to mix a few newcomers with a few veterans
                    who can offer an informal introduction to the conference.  Great for making new friends!
                </p>
                <p>More details coming soon.</p>
